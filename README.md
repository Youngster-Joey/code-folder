Nothing particularly here notable at the moment: Just small snippets of code pulled from my code folder; some are personal projects, others from internships

scuffed_24 and scuffed_163 are scuffed because, although they attemp to play the popular mental math/card game 24 and the much less popular mental math/card game 163 (same idea as 24, but with 8 cards and 163 as the goal), respectively, they miss solutions under certain conditions.
