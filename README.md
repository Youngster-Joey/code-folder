# code-folder
Nothing particularly here notable at the moment: Just snippets of code pulled from my code folder. Some were written on a whim, others are from internships

scuffed_24 and scuffed_163 are scuffed because, although they attemp to play the popular mental math/card game 24 and the much less popular mental math/card game 163 (same idea as 24, but with 8 cards and 163 as the goal), they miss solutions under certain conditions.
